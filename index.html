title: BOBILib&#58; Bilevel Optimization (Benchmark) Instance Library
---
<div class="blurb">
  Computational bilevel optimization for models including binary or
  general integer variables has been a highly active field of
  research over the last years and decades.
  To propel the development of new algorithms, it is very important
  for the community to have access to a large and well-curated set of
  test instances that can be used to test new algorithms and to
  compare different methods.
  There are very many success stories in computational optimization of
  such instance collections such
  as <a href="https://miplib.zib.de/index.html" target="_blank">MIPLIB</a>,
  <a href="https://www.minlplib.org/index.html" target="_blank">MINLPLib</a>,
  or <a href="https://qplib.zib.de" target="_blank">QPLIB</a>.
  The aim of BOBILib and this website is to provide such a test
  instance collection for (mixed) integer bilevel optimization
  including all best known feasible points.
  The entire <a href="https://bobilib.org/bobilib/instances-collection.html">collection</a> consists of more than 2500 instances.
  Moreover, we compiled
  a <a href="https://bobilib.org/bobilib/instances-benchmark.html">benchmark
  instance set</a> of 122 instances, which provides a meaningful basis
  for experimental comparisons of solution methods in a moderate
  time.

  The success of this instance collection also depends on the
  submissions from the community to let the collection grow and
  contain more and more challenging and realistic instances.
  If you have an instance that you want to contribute, please submit it via
  <a href="mailto:martin.schmidt@uni.trier.de">e-mail</a>.
