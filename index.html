  Computational bilevel optimization for models including binary or
  general integer variables have been a highly active field of
  research over the last years and decades.
  To propel the development of new algorithms, it is very important
  for the community to have access to a large and well-curated set of
  test instances that can be used to test new algorithms and to
  compare different methods.
  There are very many success stories of such instance collections
  such as <a href="https://miplib.zib.de/index.html">MIPLIB</a>
  or <a href="https://qplib.zib.de">QPLIB</a>.
  The aim of CIBOLib and this website is to provide such a test
  instance collection for (mixed-)integer bilevel optimization.
